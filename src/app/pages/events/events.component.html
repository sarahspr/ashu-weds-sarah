          Mehendi, otherwise known as henna, is a paste associated with positive
          spirits and good luck. Indian Wedding tradition calls for a Mehendi
          ceremony to be held the night before the wedding as a way of wishing
          the bride good health and prosperity as she makes her journey on to
          marriage. The Mehendi Ceremony is organized by the Bride’s family
          bringing together the female components of each side. While Mehendi is
          mainly for females, male relatives are invited to join in on the party
          that comes after the Bride has completed her henna. The core
          significance of applying Mehendi is to utilize its natural medicinal
          herbal remedies, cooling the body and relieving the Bride of any
          stress before her big day. Henna is applied to both the hands and the
          feet as a means of cooling the nerve-endings of the body, preventing
          the nerves from tensing up.

      <div class="events-section__event-description-wrapper sangeet">
        <p>
          Among the many pre-wedding events that occur prior to the Hindu,
          Punjabi, and Gujurati wedding ceremonies, the Sangeet is where the
          party begins. The word Sangeet translates to ‘sung together’ from
          Sanskrit. ‘Gaun’, another word used to describe the event, means
          ‘songs’ or ‘to sing’ in Hindi. Traditionally celebrated in the Punjab
          regions of India, this ceremony has been adopted by many other regions
          as a form of celebration for the wedding to come. The event is
          formally known to comprise of only female attendees from both sides of
          the family, however modern times allow for men to join in on the fun
          too. Unlike religious ceremonies such as the Haldi or portions of the
          wedding ceremony, the Sangeet is solely conducted to relish in the
          happiness and joy surrounding the couple.

      <div class="events-section__event-description-wrapper haldi">
        <p>
          Warmed to the very core with the color of sunshine, a Haldi ceremony
          is one tradition of many that brings a unique feel to an Indian
          wedding. It is a time of cleansing where the bride and groom’s
          families join the individuals at their respective homes to help
          prepare for the big wedding day. Using a mixture of Turmeric (Haldi)
          powder, curd, sandalwood, gram flour, and either milk or rose water,
          the family will aid in purifying the couple by applying the paste to
          the bride and groom’s skin; primarily their face, hands, arms, and
          feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          While applying a yellow paste all over the skin may seem like a rather
          odd method of cleansing, the Haldi is actually a beautiful and
          in-depth ceremony! Here are the primary reasons as to why this
          tradition is so cherished by those who participate in it:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Optimistic and hopeful for the future
            <p>
              Using Turmeric is actually quite auspicious in the Hindu culture
              as it represents purity, fertility, and overall good health. The
              beautiful yellow color is chosen to be worn by the bride and groom
              because it helps to prevent any staining of clothes that they wear
              every day, as well as further signifying the peace and happiness
              that their new life together will bring.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Glowing skin and healthy minds
            <p>
              Getting married can be a stressful event, and there’s nothing
              quite like being pampered a little to bring down the anxiety and
              welcome all the good vibes. Because Turmeric is extremely healthy
              for the skin, providing a beautiful glow, as well as containing an
              antioxidant known as curcumin (which acts as a mild
              antidepressant). The paste is a powerhouse for helping the bride
              and groom to feel fresh and relaxed for the most important day of
              their lives.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Purification and blessings
            <p>
              As Turmeric is considered to be a cleanser for both the body and
              the mind, this ritual is one of great importance for the beginning
              of the bride and groom. It is powerful in setting the tone for
              their marriage and moving forward with a clean slate, both
              physically and mentally. This is precious to those who are part of
              the Hindu culture. The ceremony is wrapped up with the bride and
              groom receiving a blessing from the elders of their families while
              traditional songs and dances commence in celebrating the union to
              come!
