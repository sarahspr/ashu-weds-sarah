        <h2>Travel to India</h2>
        <p>
          It is highly recommended to arrive in India at least 4 - 5 days before
          the weekend of the wedding. This will allow you time to recover from
          jet lag and to shop around for wedding outfits if you would like to
          wear Indian style clothing to the wedding.

            Traveling to India requires both a passport and tourist visa. If you
            do not already have a passport or need to renew it, it is
            recommended to do so as early as possible. The current routine
            processing time is 10 - 13 weeks. The current processing time for an
            expedited application is 7 - 9 weeks. You must have a passport in
            order to both purchase airfare and apply for your tourist visa (see
            below).

            Traveling to India requires a tourist visa. You can book your
            airfare before applying for your visa. The minimum time to apply for
            the visa before travel is 3 business days but it is recommended to
            apply sooner in case of any delays. The entire visa process is
            online. You can apply for a 6 month tourist at the link below. It
            will take a couple of days to receive approval by email. You will
            need to print out the approval email and carry it with you along
            with your passport.

          <p>
            The closest airport to the venue is in a city called Chandigarh
            however this is a smaller domestic airport so you wil not be able to
            get a direct flight into Chandigarh.
          </p>
          <p>
            The closest interational airport to the venue is Indira Gandhi
            International Airport in New Delhi. It is recommended to fly into
            New Delhi and then either book an Uber or take a domestic flight to
            Chandigarh.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can book a same day intercity Uber as long as you pay with cash
            which including tolls will cost you around 3,500 Indian Rupees one
            way ($43) and will take around 4.5 hours. A roundtrip domestic
            flight between New Delhi (DEL) and Chandigarh (IXC) costs around $86
            roundtrip and takes about 1 hour.
