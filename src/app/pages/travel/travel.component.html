        It is highly recommended to arrive in India at least 4 - 5 days before the weekend of the wedding. This will
        allow you time to recover from jet lag and to shop around for wedding outfits if you would like to wear Indian
        style clothing to the wedding.

      Traveling to India requires a tourist visa. You can book your airfare before applying for your visa. The minimum
      time to apply for the visa before travel is 3 business days but it is recommended to apply sooner in case of any
      delays. The entire visa process is online. You can apply for a 6 month tourist at the link below. It will take a
      couple of days to receive approval by email. You will need to print out the approval email and carry it with you
      along with your passport.

    <h3 class="travel-section__airports">Airport Options</h3>
    <p>
      The closest airport to the venue is in a city called Chandigarh however this is a smaller domestic airport so you
      wil not be able to get a direct flight into Chandigarh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The closest interational airport to the venue is Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi. It is
      recommended to fly into New Delhi and then either book an Uber or take a domestic flight to Chandigarh.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can book a same day intercity Uber as long as you pay with cash which including tolls will cost you around
      3,500 Indian Rupees one way ($43) and will take around 4.5 hours. A roundtrip domestic flight between New Delhi
      (DEL) and Chandigarh (IXC) costs around $86 roundtrip and takes about 1 hour.
