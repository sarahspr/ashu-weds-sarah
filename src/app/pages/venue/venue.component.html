    <h2 class="h3">Travel to the Venue</h2>
    <p>
      The venue is located in a small city called Kasauli which is in the foothills of the Himalayan Mountains about 2
      hours from Chandigarh. Between the wedding planners and ourselves, we will be helping to arrange transportation
      from various meeting points (to be determined) on early Saturday morning (November 4th) for guests to travel to
      the venue together sharing cabs. Shared cabs will cost around 1,700 Rs ($21) one way. For this reason, it is
      important that all guests are in Chandigarh no later than Friday, November 3rd in order to travel to the venue
      early the next morning.
